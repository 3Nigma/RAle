## What do we have here? ##
**PEA** [Romanian for *__P__achetul __E__ducațional __A__le*; *Ale Educational Package*, in English] is, like its name says, a **complete** and **free educational package** meant to teach anyone who desires (even high school pupils) the art of working with these marvelous feat of electrical engineering called *microcontrollers*. When I say **free** I truly mean it! You have no virutally restriction in using these materials (in parts or as a whole) for personal and non-commercial purposes. I only require that you acknowledge and maintain the informations regarding the true intellectual author of this project. Please check further down for a proper license association.
  
It's a package since it is composed of 3 important and interdependent elements:
* a board -called _pAle_- onto which the learner can practice what he has learned
* a book that teaches the reader how to use the board through carefully selected, easy to follow examples
* a custom application -called _psAle_- through which the user applications can be transmited to the board

**PEA** was brought together, presented to you and motivated by the author's desire to prove his belief that this wonderful domain isn't as hard as it seems. This is true; either if you are a hobbyist, member of an electronics community or singing in a choir in a church. It does not matter! As long as the reader has the curiosity and is willing to make that extra step, **PEA is for you**!

## More Pics ##
Here are a couple of real-world images that might help in a better understanding of what we are working on here. Take it as a sort of eye-candy, if you will. **Be advised that, because of the continuous improvements carried out, these images may not fully reflect the project's current state! Nevertheless, they are a good aproximation of it ...**

## Building the package ##
If you plan to build this package as a DIY challenge, note there are 3 elements that can be brought to life:
* you can print the book (cca. 230 pages, as of this writing) for a traditional, easy-to-read, experience. Or you can choose not to and use the available free ebook, saving some trees in the process!
* you can build the PCB (Eagle *sch* and *brd* files can be found in the *egl* folder). This will require some electrical engineering knowledge as well as an initial AVR programmer for configuring the board
* you can either build _psAle_ or download a binary version *[coming soon]*

## I want to participate ##
