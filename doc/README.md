## Going deeper ##
The most important files from this folder are the electronic books themselves. As of this moment, there is a complete Romanian version and an, in-progress, English version.

These materials were thought of as a key learning material through which knowledge gets passed around. This knowledge is then used to operate the PEA application control the _pAle_ board.

You can have it printed or use it as it is. It's your choice! Maybe using it in a electronic format you are more environmental-friendly (which I highly recommend) while having it physical, you can have a better interaction with the material (taking side notes, and so on) ... in the end, it doesn't matter and it's all a matter of personal taste.

Having this said, let's look at the structure of this written material. In this sense, it's a rather big book (more then 230 pages, as of this writing) structured in 3 parts :
* We start of with a historical and functional introduction to computers and microcontrollers
* We then move on and get to tackle a collection of progressively difficult examples (*__many__ examples!*) deployable on the _pAle_ board
* We end our journey by giving some future directions to follow

The document truly ends with a series of additional pages that assist the reader's saga, providing solution variants to proposed exercises, aiding in the installation and operation of _psAle_, etc.

## How can I open the book? ##
The book was first written in my native language (Romanian) and was done using Google's drive editor. Later, due to lack of functionality, I ported the text to a free word editor, namely [*version 3.5.4.2 of 'LibreOffice Writter'*](http://ro.libreoffice.org/).  
The, more recent and updated, English version of the book was written using a proper typesetting -LaTeX- language in an editor called [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).
