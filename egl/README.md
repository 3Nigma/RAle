## A little bit more details ##
On this level you will find 2 folders :

* usbtiny
* v0.9

In **usbtiny** you will find both the schematic (*.sch* file) and the board layout (*.brd* file) of [USBTinyISP's programmer version 2.0](http://www.ladyada.net/make/usbtinyisp/). It's worth mentioning that, although this circuit was not designed by the author of PEA, it was brought and indexed inside the project for easy reference.

In **v0.9**, which is short for '*pAle version 0.9*', you will find both the electrical diagram (*.sch* file) and the PCB layout (*.brd* file) of PEA's practice board.
